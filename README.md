#  ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment & Configuration
### üñ•Ô∏è [Create both Azure Virtual Machines](https://github.com/drewmarsh/azure-creating-VM)
- **Client-1** running Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2
- **DC-1** running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter Azure Edition - x64 Gen2

*Note:* Put both of these Azure Virtual Machines into a Resource Group called DC-1_group

### Configure static IP address on Domain Controller 1 (DC-1)
Open the DC-1 virtual machine and navigate to Networking > Network settings > The name of the network interface (ex. dc-1410) > IP configurations > Select 'ipconfig1' > Change ```Dynamic``` to ```Static``` > Click `Save`

<img src="/images/static-ip.png" alt="Static IP">

### RDP into DC-1 and enable ICMP inbound/outbound

After the domain controller fulling initiliazes, minimize the Server Manager window for now.

Next, use windows search to open 'Windows Defender Firewall'. Select `üõ°Ô∏è Advanced settings`

Navigate to the 'Inbound Rules' tab and find the two rules labled 'Core Networking Diagnostics - ICMP Echo Request (ICMPv4-In)'. Right-click it and select ```Enable``` on both of these rules.

Click, ```Next``` and it will bring you to the 'Domain Controller Options' tab. Here, set a secure password of your choice in the 'Password:' and 'Confirm password:' text fields.

<img src="/images/set-password.png" alt="Set Password">

On the 'DNS Options' tab, ensure the following option is unchecked: ‚óªÔ∏èCreate DNS delegation

Continue clicking ```Next``` until the 'Prerequisites Check' tab is selected (it is normal for each tab to take a while to load). Then, click ```Install```.

<img src="/images/click-install.png" alt="Click Install">

<img src="/images/installing.png" alt="Installing">

When this process completes, your connection to the DC-1 virtual machine will be lossed and you will need to RDP back into it.

<img src="/images/computer-is-restarting.png" alt="Computer Is Restarting">

However, now that DC-1 has been promoted to Domain Controller, the username used in Remote Desktop Connection will be different than what was used before. ("mydomain\" must prescede the previously used username)

<img src="/images/new-credentials.png" alt="New Credentials">

When the credentials are accepted, it will take a moment to load back to the desktop while the system waits for the Group Policy Client

### Add Organizational Units for Employees & Admins

In the top-right of the Server Manager window, navigate to 'Tools' > 'Active Directory Users and Computers'

<img src="/images/users-and-computers.png" alt="Users and Computers">

When the Active Directory Users and Computers window appears, right-click ```mydomain.com```  and then navigate to New > Organizational Unit

In the New Object - Organizational Unit window, enter "_EMPLOYEES" into the 'Name:` field and then click ```OK```

Repeat this same process except for this time, enter "_ADMINS" into the 'Name:` field and then click ```OK```

<img src="/images/employees.png" alt="_EMPLOYEES">

<img src="/images/admins.png" alt="_ADMINS">

### Add a new admin named Jane Doe

Next, right-click ```_ADMINS```  and then navigate to New > User

In the New Object - User window that will appear, enter the following information to the corresponding fields and then click ```Next```:
- First name: Jane
- Last name: Doe
- User logon name: Jane_admin

<img src="/images/new-user.png" alt="New User">

### Add the private IP address of DC-1 as the custom DNS server for Client-1
Open the Client-1 virtual machine and navigate to Networking > Network settings > The name of the network interface (ex. client-1797) > DNS servers

In the 'DNS servers' tab, Change ```Inherit from virtual network``` to ```Custom```. Then, in the 'Add DNS server' text field, enter the private IP address of the DC-1 virtual machine. Click ```Save```.

Next, restart the Client-1 virtual machine.

<img src="/images/add-dns.png" alt="Add DNS">

### Join Client-1 to the domain

RDP into the Client-1 virtual machine and then set the preferred privacy settings before booting into the desktop.

Open a Command Prompt window and test if DC-1 can pinged from the client machine (ex. ping 10.0.0.4) and verify that there is a response (this works because of the ICMP rules that were enabled earlier)

<img src="/images/ping-DC.png" alt="Ping DC">

Open a Settings window and navigate to System > About > 'Rename this PC (advanced)' > ```Change‚Ä¶```

When the Computer Name/Domain Changes window appears, enter "mydomain.com" into the 'Domain:' text field and then click ```OK```. When prompted, enter the "mydomain.com\Jane_admin" username with the corresponding password and observe the message welcoming Client-1 to the mydomain.com domain. Next, restart the Client-1 virtual machine.

<img src="/images/change-pc-name.png" alt="Change PC Name">

<img src="/images/join-domain-with-admin-credentials.png" alt="Join Domain with Admin Credentials">

While Client-1 is restarting, RDP back into the DC-1 virtual machine with "Jane_admin" account and open a new Server Manager window. 

In the top-right of the Server Manager window, navigate to 'Tools' > 'Active Directory Users and Computers'

Under mydomain.com > Computers, the Client-1 virtual machine should be listed. 

<img src="/images/client1-computer.png" alt="Client-1 Computer">

### Set-up Remote Desktop for Non-administrative Users on Client-1

In Client-1, on the "mydomain.com\Jane_admin" account, open a Settings window.

Navigate to System > Remote Desktop > ```Select users that can remotely access this PC``` > ```Add‚Ä¶```

In the 'Enter the object names to select (examples):' text field, enter "domain users" and then click the ```Check Names``` button and then click ```OK``` to close this window.

<img src="/images/domain-users.png" alt="Domain Users">

Now, all the users in that security group have the permission to RDP into the Client-1 machine.

### Active Directory Bulk User Creation Script
RDP back into the DC-1 virtual machine with "Jane_admin" account and run Windows PowerShell ISE. When the window opens, click 'File' > 'New'. A file called "Untitled1.ps1" should appear within the PowerShell ISE window. In this window, write a script to bulk create Active Directory users, or use this one. Then, run the script using the green run Run Script button on the toolbar. After a desired amount of users have been created, click the red Stop Operation button on the toolbar.

### Testing a Random Newly Created Users ‚Äî Can Their Credentials RDP Into Client-1?

See if a one of the new users in the '_EMPLOYEES' folder in the Active Directory Users and Computers window can use RDP into the Client-1 machine. The script used to bulk create active directory users gave all of these users the password of "Password1".
